To upload your code to GitHub, hit the green upload file button.

If you make changes to the file, as long as the file name remains the same, just follow the same process and GitHub will handle the rest.

Record any issues the team should be aware of under the "Issues" tab (next to the "Code" tab)

Make note of wether you are creating a pull request or commiting to the main branch

Cheers,
Thomas
